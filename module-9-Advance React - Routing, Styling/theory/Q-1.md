# What is React Router? How does it handle routing in single-page applications?

- ### React Router is a declarative routing library for React applications. It enables the creation of single-page applications (SPAs) by allowing developers to define routes that map specific URLs to different components, managing navigation without requiring full page reloads.

- react router does Component-Based Routing.React Router use components like `<BrowserRouter>`, `<Routes>`, and `<Route>` to define the application's routing structure.
    - `<BrowserRouter>` provides the routing context and manages the browser's history.
    <br>
    - `<Routes>` acts as a container for individual `<Route>` components, ensuring that only one route's component is rendered at a time based on the current URL.
    <br>
    - `<Route>` components define the path and the component to render when that path matches the current URL.

#### React Router intercepts navigation requests on the client side. it means the browser's URL changes, but the entire page content is not re-fetched from the server.

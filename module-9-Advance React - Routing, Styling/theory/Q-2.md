# Explain the difference between BrowserRouter, Route, Link, and Switch components in React Router.

1. BrowserRouter:
         This is the top-level component that enables client-side routing using the HTML5 history API. It wraps your entire application or the part of your application where routing is needed, providing the context for other routing components to function. It ensures that URL changes do not trigger a full page reload.
         <br>
2. Route:
        The Route component is used to define a mapping between a specific URL path and a React component that should be rendered when that path is matched. It takes a path prop and a component (or element in v6+) prop. When the current URL matches the path, the specified component is rendered. The exact prop can be used to ensure that the route only matches the URL exactly, preventing partial matches.
        <br>
3. Link:
        The Link component is used to create navigation links within your application. Unlike a standard `<a>` tag, Link prevents a full page reload and instead uses client-side routing to navigate to the specified to prop. This allows for a smoother, single-page application experience.
        <br>
4. Routes (in React Router v6+):
        This component replaced Switch in newer versions. It serves the same purpose of rendering only the best matching Route among its children. Routes simplifies the syntax and provides improved performance and features compared to Switch.

## `Example`

**to install react router dom**
`npm install react-router-dom`

**to use import this**
`import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
`

```jsx
    <Router>
        <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
            <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
            <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />

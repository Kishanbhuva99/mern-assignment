##  Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border, margin). How does each affect the size of an element?

* The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding, and the content itself.
<br/>
* The padding is around the content, the border is around the padding, and the margin sits outside the border. The box model describes how these features — the content, padding, border, and margin — work together to create a box as displayed by CSS.
<br/>
* elements total width = element width + (right + left border)+(right + left padding)

* elements total height = element height + (top + bottom border)+( top + bottom padding)

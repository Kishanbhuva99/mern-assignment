## What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.


- Inline CSS: Applied directly within an HTML elementâ€™s style attribute, affecting only that specific element.
<br/>
- Internal CSS: Defined within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of an HTML document, influencing the entire page.
<br/>
- External CSS: Contained in a separate .css file linked to the HTML document, allowing for consistent styling across multiple pages.

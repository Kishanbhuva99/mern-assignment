# What is Json-Server? How we use in React ?

- JSON Server is a lightweight Node.js package that allows developers to quickly create a mock RESTful API using a simple JSON file as the data source.

- A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server.When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string.Parse the data with **`JSON.parse()`** and the data becomes a JavaScript object.

## JSON SERVER in react

- `npm install -g json-server` use this command in cmd to install json server **-g for global use**.
<br>
- Create a file named **db.json** in your project's root or a dedicated api folder. This file will serve as your mock database, containing the data you want to expose through API endpoints.

- Start the JSON Server.
Run the following command in your terminal, specifying the db.json file and a port (e.g., 3001) different from React's default (3000) `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001`

### `~ Sending Data`

```javascript


const myObj = {name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York"};
const myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
window.location = "demo_json.php?x=" + myJSON;

```

### `~ Receiving Data`

```jsx


const myObj = {name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York"};
const myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
window.location = "demo_json.php?x=" + myJSON;

```

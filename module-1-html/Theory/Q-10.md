## Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better alternative? 

### Tables should be used sparingly for layout purposes because they can create several issues:

1. Accessibility: Tables used for layout can be confusing for screen readers and other assistive technologies, making it difficult for users with disabilities to navigate and understand the content.

2. Maintenance: Tables can make the HTML code more complex and harder to maintain. Making changes to the layout often requires modifying multiple table cells and rows, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

3. Flexibility: Tables are not as flexible as modern layout techniques. They can be challenging to adapt for responsive design, making it difficult to create layouts that work well on different screen sizes and devices.

4. SEO: Search engines may have difficulty understanding the content structure when tables are used for layout, potentially affecting the page's search ranking.

### Better Alternative: CSS for Layout
Using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for layout is a better alternative to tables. CSS provides more flexibility and control over the layout and design of web pages. Here are some CSS layout techniques:

1. Flexbox: The Flexbox layout model allows for the creation of flexible and responsive layouts. It is ideal for designing one-dimensional layouts, such as rows or columns.

2. Grid: The CSS Grid layout model provides a two-dimensional grid-based layout system, making it easy to design complex and responsive layouts.

3. Media Queries: Media queries allow for the creation of responsive designs by applying different styles based on the screen size or device characteristics.

##  Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission. When should each be used?

### GET Method:
<!-- <br> -->
- Purpose: The GET method is used to request data from a server. It appends the form data to the URL as query parameters.

<br>

### `Characteristics:`

- Data is visible in the URL.

- Limited amount of data can be sent (URL length restrictions).

- Suitable for retrieving data without causing any side effects.

- Can be bookmarked and cached.

### `Use Cases:`

- Searching for information (e.g., search engines).

- Retrieving data without modifying server state.

- When the data is not sensitive (e.g., filtering products on an e-commerce site).

### POST Method:
- Purpose: The POST method is used to send data to a server to create or update resources. It sends the form data in the body of the HTTP request.

<br>

### `Characteristics:`

- Data is not visible in the URL.

- No size limitations on the amount of data sent.

- Suitable for submitting sensitive or large amounts of data.

- Cannot be bookmarked or cached.

### `Use Cases:`

- Submitting forms with sensitive information (e.g., login credentials, payment details).

- Creating or updating resources on the server (e.g., submitting a contact form, uploading files).

- When the data needs to be processed securely.

### `Conclusion`

use the GET method for retrieving data and when the data is not sensitive, and use the POST method for submitting sensitive information or when you need to create or update resources on the server.

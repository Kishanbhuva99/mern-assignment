##  What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in HTML? Provide examples of each. 

### Block-Level Elements

- Definition: Block-level elements take up the full width available, starting on a new line and stacking vertically.

- Behavior: They create a "block" of content, which means they can contain other block-level elements and inline elements.

### `Example:`

`<div>:` A generic container for grouping and styling content.

`<h1> to <h6>:` Heading tags for different levels of headings.

### Inline Elements
- Definition: Inline elements take up only as much width as necessary, flowing within the content and not starting on a new line.

- Behavior: They do not create a new block of content and can only contain other inline elements or text.

### `Example:`

`<span>:` A generic container for styling a part of the text.

`<a>:` Anchor tag for hyperlinks.

`<img>:` Image tag for embedding images.

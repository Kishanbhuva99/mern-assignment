##  What is the purpose of the label element in a form, and how does it improve accessibility? 

### Purpose of the `<label>` Element:

- Descriptive Text: 
The `<label>` element provides a clear and concise description of the input field, making it easier for users to understand what information is required.

- Clickable Association: 
When a `<label>` is associated with an input element, clicking on the label will focus or activate the corresponding input field. This makes it easier for users to interact with the form, especially on touch devices.

### Improving Accessibility:
- Screen Readers: 
The `<label>` element is essential for users who rely on screen readers. Screen readers announce the label text when the user navigates to the input field, providing context and instructions for filling out the form.

- Keyboard Navigation: 
Associating labels with input fields improves keyboard navigation, allowing users to move through the form more efficiently.

- Visual Impairments: 
Labels help users with visual impairments by providing clear and descriptive text that explains the purpose of each input field.

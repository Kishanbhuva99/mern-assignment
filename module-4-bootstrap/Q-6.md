# What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group? 

- Button Groups :
 in Bootstrap it is a class of name “btn-group” which is used to create a series of buttons in groups (without spaces) vertically or horizontally.
### `Example :`
```html
<div class="btn-group">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">Click</button>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-warning">Click</button>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-success">Click</button>
    </div>
```
<br>

- also you can give size of group using btn-group-(size) class.there are 4 button sizes which you can add directly to your buttons by adding an additional class of `btn-group-size` to your “btn-group” class. No need to add separate classes to each button. size = lg(large), sm(small), xs(extra small) and regular.
<br>

- Use the class “btn-group-vertical” to create a vertical button group.

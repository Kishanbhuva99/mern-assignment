# What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work? 

- A Bootstrap container is like a box where we put all the content of our webpage. It helps to make the design look neat and organized. Bootstrap gives us three types of containers:

### `container:` 
This keeps the content in the center and adjusts its size depending on the screen, but it wonâ€™t stretch too much.
### `Example :`

```html
<div class="container">
content
</div>
```

### `.container-fluid:`
 This type of container stretches the content to fill the whole screen, no matter what size the screen is.
 ### `Example :`

```html
<div class="container-fluid">
content
</div>
```

### `.container-(breakpoint):`
 This container can be customized for specific screen sizes like small (sm), medium (md), large (lg), etc.

### `Example :`

```html
<div class="container-md">
content
</div>
```

# How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails? 

- bootstrap has built-in .img-thumbnail class to make image thumbnails.

### `.img-thumbnail :` 
This class adds the thumbnail style to images, making them smaller with a border and rounded corners.


#### `Example :`
```html
<img src="image1" class="img-thumbnail" alt="image1">
```

- also you can add custom css for effects on hover like zoom in ,border color change or flip the image.

- there are also another mathods without using img-thumbnails class for example you can use card to create thumbnails.

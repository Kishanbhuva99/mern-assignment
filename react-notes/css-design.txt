how to add external libraries like bootstrap


	-- npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap bootstrap-icons
	

	then import it in file where you want to use
	-- import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js';

	
	also you have to import components of bootstrap on your component.jsx files
	this is standard way in react
	-- import {container , card ,row} from 'react-bootstrap';





inline css -  style{{"width":"50%","padding":"20px","margin":"auto"}}

internal css - use direct on head in index.html

external css - create style.css in src/assest folder and import where you needed
